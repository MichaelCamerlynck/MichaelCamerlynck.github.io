            <h2>Short Summary</h2>
            <section id="origins">
                <h3>Origins</h3>
                <p>Fallout is a series of post-apocalyptic role-playing games produced and published by Bethesda Softworks, originally by Interplay Entertainment. Although set in and after the 22nd century, its story and artwork are heavily influenced by the post-World War II nuclear paranoia of the 1950s. The series is lightly based on the Mad Max film series, and is sometimes considered to be a spiritual successor to Wasteland.</p>

                <h3>Storyline</h3>
                <p>The background story of Fallout involves a "what-if" scenario in which the United States of America tries to devise fusion power resulting in the whole country becoming hegemonic and having less reliance on petroleum. However, this is not achieved until 2077, shortly after an oil drilling conflict off the Pacific Coast pits the United States against China. It ends with a nuclear exchange resulting in the post-apocalyptic world in which the game takes place.</p>
                <p>Before the nuclear exchange took place, great underground Vaults were constructed across America, supposedly to protect the populace from the dangers of radiation. Although only 122 were constructed, over 400,000 would be needed to protect the entire nation. This is because the Vaults were not intended to save humanity; rather, they were social experiments being conducted by the United States government. Most vaults featured some variables to test how certain things influence people or how they would react.</p>
